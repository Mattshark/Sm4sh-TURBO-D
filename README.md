# Sm4sh-TURBO-D

Every Smash Fighter... TURBO'D!

My first ever project, github, and community collection!

Currently 3ds Only, since I don't have a hacked WiiU to test any fighters there...

# Installation

This project was made with SaltySD in mind; If you don't know what this is, check the "Applying Patches" Section here:

http://gbatemp.net/threads/smash-3ds-complete-rom-hacking-guide-textures-music-sfx-voice-clips.414548/

Once that's set up, click on the DOWNLOAD ZIP file at the top right of this github page to download the fighters.

Then, on your SD card, drag the "animcmd" file (included in the download) inside your SaltySD\smash\ directory. (Create folder named "SaltySD", enter it, Create "smash" folder, enter it, drag the folder "animcmd" into here)

Regenerate your cache, and you're done! (If you don't know how to "generate the cache" or haven't done that before, you can ignore this step; It just makes loading times faster, see the GbaTemp Link above for more info)
